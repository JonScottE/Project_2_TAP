# Method and goal
Using historical data we will attempt to predict future prices on 4 assets: </br></br>
Gold, SPY, BTC, ETH, using ScykitLearn.</br></br>

From there we will add a layer of sentiment analysis using natural language processing,</br>
to see if it improves or worsens our model.

Ultimately, we would like to idewntify a predictor in crypto assets </br>
based on a cross of the price of gold and spy.

Technical Requirements
[ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook, **Google Colab** Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.

* [ ] Optionally, apply a **dimensionality reduction technique** to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.

* [ ] Create one or more machine learning models.

* [ ] **Fit** the model(s) to the training data.

* [ ] **Evaluate the trained model(s)** using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.

* [ ] **Show the predictions** using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.

* [ ] **Save PNG images** of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.

* [ ] Use **one new machine learning library**, machine learning model, or evaluation metric **that hasn't been covered in class**.

* [ ] **Create a README.md** in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
