# Project_2_TAP
Second Project for Team Awesome Pants


What Problem are we trying to solve, or what prediction are we trying to make?


What data will we feed our model?


What machine learning library will we use?




Technical Requirements
[ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook, **Google Colab** Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.

* [ ] Optionally, apply a **dimensionality reduction technique** to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.

* [ ] Create one or more machine learning models.

* [ ] **Fit** the model(s) to the training data.

* [ ] **Evaluate the trained model(s)** using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.

* [ ] **Show the predictions** using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.

* [ ] **Save PNG images** of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.

* [ ] Use **one new machine learning library**, machine learning model, or evaluation metric **that hasn't been covered in class**.

* [ ] **Create a README.md** in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
